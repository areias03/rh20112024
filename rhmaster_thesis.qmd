## Introduction

-   This work was developed as part of my Master's in Bioinformatics degree from Universidade do Minho in Braga, Portugal
-   It was accomplished under the supervision of Vitor Manuel Sá Pereira from CEB - Universidade do Minho and Sarela Garcia Santamarina from IQTB - Nova University in Lisbon, Portugal
-   Aimed to develop a novel methodology to the study of the effects of transition metals in gut microbial communities

## Context

-   Community settings are the natural occurring form of microbes
-   The study of communities provide researchers with the knowledge of the effect of individuals/groups of individuals in community dynamics, resource availability and even diversity 
-   Experimental approaches are insufficient in capturing the entirety of the interactions that occur in these complex biological systems
-   The modelling of microbial communities through the use of genomic reconstructions is a widely used approach

## The problem

-   Community models created from non-enhanced GEMs are often unable to capture crucial microbe-microbe interactions as their innate inability to attain different flux distribution profiles often produces results that widely differ from those obtain in *in vitro* settings 
-   Really strict measurements have to be taken into account when defining the growth media and community composition
-   Even then, models often underperform as they do not present a growth that is remotely realistic in terms of real observations

## The solution

-   The combination of two approaches supported by experimental data for integration and comparison can shed new light on the community dynamics promoted through the behavior of individuals

## Goals

-   Develop an automated workflow to generate genome-scale metabolic models enhanced with enzymatic constraints
-   Create compartmentalized community models for target communities
-   Attain similar growth profiles as those observed *in vitro*
-   Capture a experimentally observed "piggy-back" mechanism between *B. thetaiotaomicron VPI 5482* and *E. coli ED1a* ^[Zhu, Wenhan, et al. "Xenosiderophore utilization promotes Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron resilience during colitis." Cell host & microbe 27.3 (2020): 376-388.]

## Model obtention

-   A  list of 7 models was obtained from the AGORA^[Heinken, A., Hertel, J., Acharya, G. et al. Genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of 7,302 human microorganisms for personalized medicine. Nat Biotechnol 41, 1320–1331 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01628-0] database by matching against the provided list of strains.
-   The models were *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* VPI 5482, *Bacteroides uniformis* ATCC 8492, *Escherichia coli* ED1a, *Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum* ATCC 25586, 
*Roseburia intestinalis* L1 82, *Streptococcus parasanguinis* ATCC 15912 and *Streptococcus salivarius* DSM 20560 (Bt, Bu, Ec, Fn, Ri, Sp and Ss)

## Enhancement of models with enzyme constraints

-   Models were scraped for their annotations and then information was queried from various databases and k~cat~ values were also predicted using a deep-learning model
-   A mapping of genes and reactions of each model was made and the due alterations to each reaction were made accordingly (change stoichiometry, splitting isozymes, converting to irreversible)

## Simulation methods

-   **FBA - Flux Balance Analysis:** Direct extension of Flux Balance Analysis (or joint FBA) that integrates metabolic reconstructions of individual microbial species into a multi-compartment model with a community compartment allowing for the exchange of metabolites between species. The optimization objective function is usually the sum of the biomass reactions of individual species (called the community biomass).
-   **SteadyCom:** Community simulation method that takes extends the capabilities of FBA by taking into account the fact that to reach a stable composition the organisms need to grow at the same specific growth rate (1/h), which means that the absolute growth rate (gDW/h) of each organism is proportional to its abundance at steady-state (gDW).

## Workflow

-   Growth media were based on provided growth profiles obtained experimentally
-   Models were tuned to fit their real profiles and then sampled
-   This cyclical workflow followed a mostly 'trial-and-error' approach that saw adjustments at each iteration

## Effects on community stability

-   In simulations ran through FBA, across all samples, enzyme-constrained or not, there was growth in almost all media that maintained a reasonable level of organic or inorganic iron 
-   When comparing communities of enhanced vs non-enhanced models it was observed that under SteadyCom only enhanced communities had growth in low iron conditions
-   This further proves that enhancing the models promotes a stable consortium between all members of a community by capping the overtaking of resources by species that possess a higher rate of consumption of metabolites

## *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* growth during colitis 

-   Results in **FBA** simulations were stable across all samples and media
-   In SteadyCom:
    -   Only sample 2 had growth
    -   Samples 2 and 3 were the only ones where *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron* had an abundance bigger than 0
    -   0.0000231 and 0.0000893 in sample 2 in media 2 and 3

## Conclusions

-   A novel framework to integrate enzyme contraints in commmunity models was developed
-   The generated models were able to attain uptake profiles similar to those observed in the lab
-   The methodology was validated through the capturing of a published microbe-microbe interaction
